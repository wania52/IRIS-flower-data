# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flowers using both traditional machine learning techniques (specifically Logistic Regression) and a deep learning model.

## Introduction

This project showcases the application of machine learning and deep learning for the classification of Iris flowers. The goal is to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their characteristics, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Logistic Regression Model

Logistic Regression is a widely used classification algorithm that predicts the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class. In this project, Logistic Regression is employed to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their features.

## Deep Learning Model

In addition to traditional machine learning techniques, a deep learning model is also utilized for Iris flower classification. Deep learning offers the advantage of automatically learning feature representations from data, potentially capturing complex patterns that may be challenging for traditional algorithms.

## Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is used for training and testing both the logistic regression model and the deep learning model. It consists of 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the Iris flower, with three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Usage

To use this project:
1. Install Python and the required libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the Python scripts containing the logistic regression model and the deep learning model.
4. Explore the results, including accuracy scores and predictions for both models.
